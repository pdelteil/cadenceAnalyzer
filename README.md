# cadenceAnalyzer
Tool to identify low cadence segments that might trigger a change in crankset/chainrings to increase cadence and therefore improve time and performance.
fiThis task is achived using cycle computer data (speed, cadence and time). The tool processes **fit, tcx and gpx files.**

## Scenario 

A cyclist climbs a 15% gradient road averaging 35 **RPMs** during 20 minutes, using a 52/39 crankset and a 11/28 cassette. 

## Questions

How much faster could this climb be accomplished using a different gear ratio? 

How many seconds would the climber save if using a 11/34 cassette?

## Assumptions 

1. The crank arm length is constant. 
2. Low cadence while climbing is strongly correlated to higher heart rate (BPM). 
3. Low cadence while climbing is strongly correlated to a high percentage of FTP. (90%-110%)
